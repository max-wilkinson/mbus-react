# MBus

MBus is built to be a different kind of mobility app. It intelligently uses your current location to show you the bus arrival times for the stops closest to you.

## Background

A bus app should be simple and smart. With the MBus app there is no need to scroll around a map, or look through dozens of stops just to find the one you want. Just open the app and you're good to go.

With MBus, you are always in control. Your location will only be fetched when the app launches, and when you tap on the update location button.

> Note: Your location is only used to find nearby bus stops. It is not stored or shared.

## Features

This version of MBus is a React web app. This means it will run in any modern browser. It is also designed to support the PWA (progressive web app) paradigm.

> A hosted version of the app can be accessed at: https://max-wilkinson.github.io/mbus-react

## Release Notes

MBus is in public beta. I am hard at work creating the best experience possible for this app. If you have any feedback, feel free to submit an issue to this repository.
